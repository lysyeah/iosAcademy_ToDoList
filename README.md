## This is what I learned while listening to the lessons of IOS ACADEMY.
- It is the clone Coding for practice Swift UI 
- Used architecture : MVVM
- DataBase : firebase( firebaseAuth, firbaseStore )

## function
- Sign up, in, out
- Add some lists and delete them with sliding
- On the Profile tab, you can view your profile information stored in the database.
- checking on/off lists using the buttons.

## What I learned through this lecture
- I tasted the swiftUI, instead of the storyboard.
- I have seen how the MVVM architecture is used.
